# LOST CAUSE COMMUNITY DOCUMENTATION - OVERVIEW

Lost Cause Projects enable ideas from the community to be recognized, evaluated, and completed using a community framework. As creatives, we have ideas constantly. We want to enable the ideas to be captured "in the momemnt" quickly and frictionlessly with so that they may benefit from a structured process to increase the likeliness of of seeing visions turn into realities. The structured managment of projects can feel restrictive and anti-creative in both language and function, but ultimately, a structured process helps creatives get to results. Our communinity benefits from a diverse population, and a power of that is the ability to create art. It is our hope to apply aesthetic principals in both function & form to the management of projects, while realizing the holistic benefits - both communally and individually - that come from engagment with community projects.

## Goal of Framework
---
- frictionlessly take in project ideas from community members
- process and evaluate those ideas as a community using structured steps/status
- engage, defer, or abandon the project
- complete projects we undertake


Enough talk, we can add a manifesto later. At this time, we urgently need something functioning. The first versions of this documentation will intend to be more functional than aesthetic in order to enable the community to get to some first results quicker.
