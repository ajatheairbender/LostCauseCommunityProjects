# Not Started

## Intake

---

### Description

goal is to real-time capture thoughts frictionlessly and instantly, as not to let the spark of inspiration pass. 

off-load more critical thinking to processing and evaluation steps.

we want to capture ideas in real-time with relative ease - this is the concept of intake. my mom use to say “if its not written down, it doesnt exist”.  once intake is complete, you can either directly engage or with the next step of processing, or defer processing to another time (you can schedule independently OR we will create a recurring project processing event that others can join and input #TODO - send google form out to folks to get preferred times, likely combine this with recurring group meet - what else goes on this meet - general project updates and discussions, financial update, upcoming events, open discussion, defining and confirming of community/shared goals…)

intake methods

- google form
- discord bot (coming soon)
- iphone short cut (coming soon)
- text msg (can use voice comand) to # ____ (coming soon)

intake requirements

- originator

optional

- all other fields for backlog (will all be evaluated and confirmed)

### Description

goal is to store potential projects once they have more details (initially processed from intake)

### priority

prioritization is key to understanding if a project should be pursued. 

priority can be established by considering

- individual goals
- shared/community goals
- capacity
- ability to complete
- financial outcome

at this point, financial outcome is a large priority driver as many community members have goals to make their lives self-sustaining through doing certain functions (creating art, managing business, etc). by leading priority with financial income, we can achieve a shared goal of getting community to a place where the time-horizon of projects and income is predictable enough, members can rely on the infrastructure.

another key consideration of priority is that the resources/functions needed to complete are things that people want to do. this is the whole point of engaging with projects, and we should try to minimize doing things that we don’t want to do AND are out of line with our individual goals (whether by not achieving them directly or not making a step toward achieving)

another key consideration for priority is capacity. the members participating acting as resources/functions must be able to deliver (both time and ability wise)
